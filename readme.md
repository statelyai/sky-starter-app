The [traffic light example](https://sky-starter.stately.ai/?page=trafficlight) shows how you can even use delayed transitions on Sky.


### .env file

We have included a `.env` file in this starter app. You should not commit an `.env` file to your own repository, but we have included it here for convenience to get started quickly.
